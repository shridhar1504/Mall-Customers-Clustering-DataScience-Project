# Mall-Customers-Clustering-DataScience-Project
In this project, we analyze a dataset of mall customers to understand their characteristics, preferences, and behaviors. By applying data analysis techniques and clustering algorithms, we aim to identify customer segments based on their shopping patterns and annual income.
## Dataset Description:
The dataset is provided in a CSV (Comma Separated Values) format, where each row represents a customer and each column represents a specific attribute. The dataset includes the following information:
* ### CustomerID:
  Unique identifier for each customer.
* ### Gender:
  Gender of the customer (male or female).
* ### Age:
  Age of the customer.
* ### Annual Income:
   Annual income of the customer in monetary units.
* ### Spending Score:
   A score assigned to the customer based on their shopping behavior and spending patterns.

The dataset aims to identify meaningful customer segments or clusters based on their demographic information and spendingÂ behavior.
## Observation:
Based on the analysis of the Mall Customer Cluster Dataset, the following observations can be made:
* ### Gender Distribution:
  The dataset provides insights into the gender distribution of mall customers, allowing for an examination of potential gender-based shopping preferences.
* ### Age Distribution:
  The age distribution of mall customers can be observed, providing information on the age groups that frequent the mall.
* ### Income Variation:
  The dataset includes annual income information, allowing for the analysis of income differences among customers and its potential influence on spending behavior.
* ### Spending Score:
  The spending score assigned to customers indicates their shopping behavior and spending patterns, enabling the identification of potential high-value customers or different customer segments.
## Problem Statement:
The problem addressed by the Mall Customer Cluster Dataset is to segment customers based on their shopping behavior and annual income. The dataset aims to answer questions such as:
* Can we identify distinct customer segments or clusters based on their spending patterns?
* What are the key factors of the annual income that influence customer behavior in the mall?
* How can we develop targeted marketing strategies for different customer segments?
## Solution Approach:
The solution approach involves utilizing the Mall Customer Cluster Dataset to segment customers and gain insights into their shopping behavior. The following steps can be followed:

1. ### Data Loading:
   Load the dataset file (dataset.csv) into your preferred programming environment or data analysis tool.

2. ### Data Preprocessing:
   Perform any necessary data cleaning and preprocessing steps, such as handling missing values or outliers, encoding categorical variables (if any), and scaling numerical features.

3. ### Exploratory Data Analysis:
   Explore the dataset by visualizing the distribution of different variables, examining correlations between variables, and identifying any patterns or trends.

4. ### Feature Selection:
   Select relevant features that contribute significantly to customer segmentation and spending behavior, based on exploratory data analysis and domain knowledge.

5. ### Customer Segmentation:
   Apply clustering algorithms such as K-means, hierarchical clustering into distinct segments based on their spending behavior and annual income.

6. ### Cluster Analysis:
   Analyze the characteristics and traits of each customer segment to gain insights into their preferences, needs, and behaviors. Compare the clusters to identify distinct groups and their unique characteristics.
